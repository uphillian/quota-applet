Quota Notification Applet
Thomas Uphill <uphill at ias dot edu>

This applet sets a status icon and checks quota usage every few mintes.  If the user goes over a 
yellow or red set point, the icon changes color and an inotify is triggered to let the user know
they are about to go over quota.  The user may also click on the icon to get current quota usage.
